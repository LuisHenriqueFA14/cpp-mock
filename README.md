<p align="center">This is my attempt to make a mock database in C++.</p>

## What is that ?

This project is about a mock database in C++, BUT i made a CLI too.

In the project you have a very simple register/login system.

(The most important part about this project is the mock database)

## How to use

After download, run these commands to compile:

```
chmod +x ./scripts/build.sh
./scripts/build.sh
```

## Details

To the Mock database, i'm using an array, and there are models and repositories.
